      "- Historically, rules of war evolved with the aristocracy aiming for \"gentlemanly\" conduct, sparing officers.\n",
      "- The American Revolution saw the rise of sharpshooters who targeted officers, impacting the Battle of Saratoga.\n",
      "- While not official policy, American sharpshooters continued targeting officers for tactical advantage.\n",

      "- Formal treaties, like the Geneva Convention, prohibit targeting medics and medical personnel.\n",
      "- The Geneva Convention dictates the treatment of wounded soldiers and medical staff.\n",
      "- Medics are not to be taken prisoner and should be returned to their lines.\n",
      "- Medics can carry personal protection weapons but forfeit non-combatant status if engaging offensively.\n",

      "\n",
      "- The Japanese military prioritized killing medics in the Pacific Theater despite signing the Hague and Geneva Conventions.\n",
      "- Japanese leadership believed upholding the treaty would encourage American bombing.\n",
      "- American medics were often targeted and eventually abandoned distinguishing insignia. \n",
      "- Medics in the Pacific routinely carried weapons and fought alongside comrades due to the disregard for the Geneva Convention. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Chapter 6: Desmond Doss and the Targeting of Medics\n",

      "\n",
      "## Chapter 7: Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "- Targeting medics has been a persistent issue despite international laws and conventions.\n",
