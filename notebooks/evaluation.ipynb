      " War crimes against medics As a way to alleviate some of the horrors of combat, social convention and international law make some individuals on the battlefield off limits to deliberate targeting. Very often, however, in the heat of battle, these conventions are ignored, and those who should be off limits are intentionally targeted. Individuals and customs of war date back centuries. By the 18th century, the majority of the officer class and an army would be made up of the aristocracy, men of wealth and privilege. These individuals would often attempt to conduct war in a gentlemanly fashion. One of these involved the treatment of enemy officers in battle. The deliberate shooting of officers was considered barbaric and to be avoided. During the American Revolution, while it was never official policy to target officers, the Continental Army did create a unit of sharp shooters who made use of highly accurate long-range rifles, giving them the ability to pick specific targets as opposed to their regular army counterparts who were armed with much less accurate smooth-bore muskets. Under the command of Frontiers Mandanil Morgan, these rifles played a decisive role at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. According to legend, one of his men, Timothy Murphy, under Morgan's orders, deliberately shot and killed British General Simon Fraser. Morgan's other men also targeted other officers and artillerymen, throwing the British advance into confusion, allowing the Continental Army to win the battle. Exactly what did happen is a bit vague, but Fraser and the other officers were definitely targeted by American sharp shooters, giving the Continental Army a decisive advantage. While there was never an official policy to target such individuals, those with the means to do so were more than willing to seek out officers for special attention, no matter how barbaric it may seem.

Over the years, restrictions on targets were formalized into official treaties. One of the most prominent of these restrictions is the prohibition of medics and medical personnel as legitimate targets. Some nations however not only refuse to acknowledge these international guidelines, but also made the deliberate targeting of medics a standard tactic to be used by their armed forces. Two treaties that govern the conduct of soldiers on the battlefield are the Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention. The latter is a series of agreements dating back to 1864, which govern the conduct of soldiers on the battlefield. It was updated in 1906, 1929 and most recently in 1947. Though additions have been made and the exact wording of the treaty has changed over the years, any deliberate attack on a medic or medical personnel or any unnecessary hindrance in the performance of their duties is considered a war crime and can be prosecuted accordingly. Furthermore medics are not to be taken as prisoners of war, should one be captured, he should be returned to friendly lines as soon as practical and no distinction is to be made between military medical staff and civilians. Temporary auxiliary medical personnel such as stretcher vera and those who transported wounded or sick soldiers are also considered non-combatants while performing their duties and given the same consideration as designated medics. Medics are allowed to carry weapons for personal protection or to defend the wounded under their care without forfeiting their status as a non-combatant. However, should the medic engage in offensive combat alongside other soldiers, he would forfeit his immunity and be treated like any other soldier. For the most part during World War II, medics did not carry weapons, though there were some exceptions. To ensure these personnel are easily identified to ensure their protected status, many nations would mark them with special symbols, most often a red cross on a white background. This symbol would be displayed on tents, vehicles, as well as helmets and arm bands as a quick visual reminder of the special status of the bearer. During World War II, most major powers were signatories of the conventions, including the United States, Great Britain and Germany. By large, these nations respected medics and avoided deliberately shooting them while they tended to the wounded. There were some exceptions to this. For example, some SS units would intentionally wound enemy soldiers, when medical aid arrived on the scene to treat the casualty, the SS soldier would fire on the medic, hopefully killing him. There are also incidents of allied soldiers firing on German medical personnel in clear and deliberate violations of the hage and Geneva conventions. While there are many examples of this happening on both sides, for the most part the non-combatant status of the medics was respected on the western front. Medics would often tend to soldiers of either side, in one example a pair of American medics used to French church as an aid station on D-Day, 1944. Wounded soldiers from both sides were given the same treatment, the only restriction was that all patients had to leave their weapons outside. Both American and German soldiers' lives were saved due to their intervention. On the eastern front the situation was entirely different. The Soviet Union did not sign the Geneva Convention, and the hage conventions were signed by Russia in 1899 and 1907, but the Soviet Union never confirming its status as signatory, which provided the justification for Nazi mistreatment of both prisoners and medical staff. When in combat medics would be treated like any other soldier and would be eliminated without hesitation. Without a Soviet medic be captured, he would be sent to a POW camp as any other soldier. Conditions in these camps were horrendous, with the Nazi regime deliberately underfeeding Soviet POWs. The main aims of the German war effort in the eastern theater of the war was Lebensraum, or Living Space for ethnic Germans. As a result, treating the Soviets be they medic, prisoner or any other protected class with utter contempt, flew in the face of the Nazi ideology. In response, Soviet soldiers also didn't respect German medics or medical personnel. The war on the eastern front was one of untold brutality, with both sides committing atrocities against the other with no regard for international law. Across the globe in the Pacific Theater of the War, another military would make the killing of medics a priority. As the United States and other allied powers conducted their island hopping campaign, it was soon apparent that the non-combatant status afforded to those in medical fields was not applicable. Although the Empire of Japan did sign the Hague Convention in 1907, and it also signed the Geneva Convention of 1929, but it didn't ratify it, Japanese leadership believed that upholding the treaty would encourage the Americans to bomb Japanese cities, as any captured airmen would be treated as legitimate POWs, rather than war criminals, which was what the Japanese considered them to be. As a result, the provisions of the conventions were ignored. While on campaign, many medics found themselves the subject of special attention from their Japanese foes. The Red Cross on a white background that was worn on both helmets and on bands, symbols that in other theaters provided a degree of protection, did little more than single out the wearer as the subject of special attention. Medics and Korman would remove these insignia and wear the same uniforms as their comrades, as any feature that distinguish them as medical personnel would only put their lives in unnecessary risk. Additionally, Medics and Korman in the Pacific Theater would routinely carry weapons and fight alongside their comrades, though it was a direct violation of the Geneva Convention there was little point in following its rules, as the enemy didn't respect the convention anyway. Army Medic and Medal of Honor recipient Desmond Dawes noted the Japanese obsession for attacking medical personnel. In one interview after the war, he stated, quote, As Dawes states, the main reason for targeting medics was to harm American morale. Should a soldier be wounded, it should be the actions of a medic that would be the difference between life and death. Should the medic be killed or otherwise incapacitated, there would be no immediate aid for any other wounded soldier. For centuries, the designation of legitimate and illegitimate targets has been enforced both as a social convention and informal treaties. In spite of this, many have simply ignored these restrictions in order to gain an advantage on the battlefield.\n",

      " The Medic Who Thought a War Without a Weapon Desmond Doss was not your average hero. He would become a Medal of Honor recipient, the United States of America's highest and most prestigious military award, as a combat medic who saved many of his comrades' lives in battle without firing a single shot, because he didn't take a weapon into combat because of his religious beliefs. Desmond Doss was born in 1919 in the state of Virginia and was raised as a strict 7th-day eventist, a Christian denomination that believed that Saturday was the Sabbath and that the second coming of Jesus Christ was imminent. They also believed strongly in non-violence and a healthy diet based typically on a vegetarian diet. Doss had been raised with a strict belief in the Bible, and when it came to the 10 commandments, he took them to be the core values of how to lead his life. When World War II started, he was conflicted as he believed the war was a just one, but he felt that to kill another human being under any circumstance was wrong. He was already employed as a joiner at Newport News Naval Shipyard, but nevertheless he joined the United States Army on April 1, 1942. He could have requested a deferment, but he wanted to do his patriotic duty. He was assigned to an infantry unit, the 77th Division, and presumed that his classification as a conscientious objector would not require him to carry a weapon. For Doss, one commandment of the Bible stuck with him the most, thou shalt not kill. He wondered why he was assigned as a rifleman and not in a medical role. His commanding officer tried to pressure Doss into carrying a weapon as they thought he would be more of a liability than an asset in combat, but Doss refused. Interestingly, even for medics, which Doss would later become, it was common practice at the time to carry either an M1911A1 pistol or M1 carbine for self-defense purposes. The rules go that a medic under the Geneva Convention is not forbidden from carrying a weapon, but if a medic fires his weapon, he stops being classed as a medic, and therefore can be legitimately fired upon by the enemy. The regimental chaplain, Captain Stanley, would soon understand Doss' protests and helped him transfer from riflemen to medical training. To make matters worse, his fellow soldiers mocked his religious beliefs when he was reading the Bible daily and strictly observing the 7th-day eventous tradition of attending church every Saturday. Doss continuously requested to be allowed to have Saturdays off, rather than Sundays, in order to follow his Adventist beliefs, at Saturday was to be observed as the Sabbath. In the end, Captain Stanley took this up with the visual headquarters, and it was decided that eventist soldiers would have Saturdays off, just as the other men had Sunday off. This in fact made Doss even more unpopular than ever with his fellow soldiers, as he was seen to have it easy. As he had Saturdays off, none wore on base on Sundays to see him pull extra duties to make up for this. One of the squad's other soldiers summed up the company's feeling about him and his Saturdays off complaining. You get more passes than the general. As Doss was a strict vegetarian at a time when it was unusual, it meant that the rest of the unit viewed Doss with such distrust and hostility that one man in his unit even warned him ominously. When we go into combat, Doss, you're not coming back alive. I'm going to shoot you myself. Doss eventually became an army combat medic saying, while others are taking life, I will be saving it. The turning point for Doss and his relationship with his company came with their first 25 mile march, with full field pack and rifle, something they were expected to achieve in eight hours. The other soldiers thought Doss would be having it easy as he would be carrying no rifle or ammo that day, but his two canvas medical bags were almost as heavy and much more awkward to carry than any rifle. As the march progressed, the men started to suffer from exhaustion. Doss had a lot of stress, blistered feet and dehydration, some even passed out. At all the time there was Doss, always with a helping hand. Even to the extent that at the end of the march, he insisted on checking everyone's feet and administering medical aid where it was needed. By the end of that day, he had won the respect of his entire unit for his tireless devotion to his duty. For the first time, he was treated as one of their own. Doss has the qualified combat medic of the unit was now responsible for providing first aid and front line trauma care on the battlefield. He would be assigned to accompany his unit into the war zone and be there with them on the front line at all times. This was soon to happen for the 77th Division had had their first combat experience on May 11, 1943, and Doss and his comrades were urgently being trained up to replace the combat losses and help expand the division's strength. The 77th Division would end up being in combat officially for no less than 208 days, suffering a total of 9,212 casualties before the war would end. The Battle of Guam Doss's first taste of combat was at the Battle of Guam, which was a bloody battle fought from July 21 to August 10, 1944, to recapture the US territory of the island of Guam from a determined Japanese garrison of nearly 20,000 troops. Though according to the Geneva Convention, knowingly firing at a medic wearing a clear insignia is a war crime, the Japanese snipers and machine gunners tended to ignore this and saw combat medics as easy and valuable targets to gun down. So medics in the Pacific theater were often told to avoid wearing medical insignia in case it would make them more, not less of a target. Doss was under fire nearly every day during the battle and was busy doing his part in saving lives. Guam had shown Doss how cruel war could be as his unit was pushing forward through the jungle on their first day, a young fresh face recruit spotted a fountain pen laying on the jungle floor and went to pick it up. Before anyone could warn him otherwise, a white phosphorus grenade exploded. The pen had been booby trapped. The young man who had picked up the pen, his chest, now a bloody mess, had blood pouring out of an open wound, severe burns and sharp metal fragments covered his body and he was going into shock. By some miracle, Doss managed to stabilize his condition, administering care and helping to evacuate him and three other soldiers who had been wounded by flying Red Hot Shrapnel. This was Doss's first taste of combat casualties. The US casualties during the battle was truly appalling. Of the 59,000 US troops who took part in the invasion around every one in six were either killed or wounded. The Battle of Laty Next, Doss and his unit was involved in the Battle of Laty in the Philippines that ran from October 17th to December 26th, 1944. A vicious and prolonged battle which started with a huge US coastal bombardment and in fibious landing, followed by heavy fighting the more inland the Americans went. During a Japanese counterattack, a fellow medic, Clarence Glenn had heard the call for a medic from a machine gunner. He left the cover and went into the open into no man's land to get the wounded man and was himself hit. Glenn was Doss's friend from back home and he couldn't leave him there. So he and a litter bearer, Herb Shecter, went out to find the two wounded and dealt with them separately. This was attending the machine gunner who had a gash along his face while bullets whizzed overhead. Both of the wounded were alive. They made an improvised litter out of a poncho and tree branches to get the wounded man back to the aid station, but his friend Glenn would die before he made it. From this point on, Doss would not look at the face of the man he was treating in case it was another friend. Sadly, his friend Herb would be shot and killed when he and Doss were carrying a litter as their silhouette exposed them against the sky to the enemy. On top of losing his friends, Doss was constantly hungry because the meat in the K-rashans conflicted with his vegetarianism so he could only eat the tasteless crackers and coconuts he found. On Lady, the coconuts on the ground gave him diarrhea so he climbed the trees for fresh ones. At one point, Doss was looking for coconuts. It attracted poorly aimed Japanese machine gun fire. When they were killed by American soldiers, it was later discovered that they had been drunk on sake. One thing that shocked Doss during the most devastating times of the campaign was that the same man who had made threats towards him during training at Fort Jackson now came to him for guidance and to pray for him. The Battle of Okinawa And lastly, for Doss and the 77th Infantry Division was a battle that was to be the bloodiest battle of the war in the Pacific, as well as its largest amphibious landing. The US objective was to secure the island as a base as it was just 350 miles south of the Japanese mainland and would be strategically crucial for any future invasion of Japan. The battle started on April 1, 1945, exactly three years to the day that Doss first enlisted in the army and the battle was to last 81 days. Doss was assigned to the first battalion as their combat medic. On April 29, 1945, the 77th Division was given the task of assaulting on a 400 foot high cliff called the Maida Escarpment. This was nicknamed by the Americans as Haxal Ridge. Before they climbed the cargo net, Doss set a prayer for his comrades. When Doss's unit joined the assault and as they neared the top of the escarpment, they came under intense Japanese artillery, small arms and machine gun fire, inflicting severe casualties on the assaulting American troops. The American forces had sent in wave after wave of troops to try to dislodge a fanatical enemy base there who were well entrenched and camouflaged. On May 4, while his unit was attacking a heavily fortified enemy position at the mouth of a cave, Doss went to the aid of four of his injured comrades. The lieutenant who led the attack on the emplacement had intended to throw a grenade when an enemy bullet hit him and delayed it, blowing his hand off and wounding his comrades. Despite having to get within 25 feet of the enemy lines and under attack by enemy grenades at gunfire, Doss managed to get to the injured men. He again managed to evacuate the men back to his own lines, one by one. During the night, the Japanese continued to throw grenades and kept up the mortar fire. The American soldiers hid in rock crevices, but the Japanese found ways to infiltrate and sneak up on them. Then on the next day, May 5, he came to the rescue of a wounded artillery officer who had gone to see how the artillery guns were doing. Doss's left leg was now injured as he had fell the day before down the edge of a parapet. He climbed up the cargo net with his first aid kits, his weight falling on his bad leg. Finding him in a shell hole, the officer had been struck by shrapnel that had made a hole from his chest to his back and Doss could hear him breathing through it. He was bleeding heavily. Doss gave him first aid while under constant enemy gunfire and shelling. He put the dressings over the large holes in the Colonel's chest and back, and administered blood plasma which dangerously exposed Doss to the enemy as he had to hold it up high. Doss's efforts here would be in vain as the Colonel carried back on a stretcher, died before he reached the aid station. Later, there were orders to take a vital Japanese pillbox position on the reverse slope of a hill that was holding up the American advance. Desmond Doss, once he had read his prayers, was happy to support the assault. The American troops threw gasoline cans at the position which triggered a large explosion. All of a sudden, a large Japanese counterattack overwhelmed the American soldiers, causing them to panic and rush back to the edge of the cliff. But despite this, Doss refused to take cover and while constantly under heavy fire by the enemy, though being totally exhausted, he spent hours carrying the wounded one by one to the edge of the escarpment. Then, to get the more severely wounded down, he tied a rope to a tree stump and lowered them down the cliff on a rope-supported stretcher to safety. When the stretcher kept slipping, he turned to a new method, looping the rope around the wounded men's chest and legs to lower them down. Doss, standing, exposed to potential enemy fire, was seen praying at the cliff edge as the men were being lowered down. And later, he had said he had been praying to the Lord to help him get one more, and after that, one more, until they were all down. Calculating the wounded men at the base of the cliff, the captain worked out that Doss had saved around 75 men. The Americans would eventually go back up the cliff and on May 7th would take the position. By some miracle, Doss survived the whole battle totally unheard, but that was soon to change. On May 21st, in the confusion of a night attack, Doss tended to the American wounded, risking being hit by both the Japanese and by friendly fire. Doss was in a shell hole with another American soldier when a grenade landed beneath him. His reflex action was to put his foot on it and was seriously wounded in both legs. His blood poured out from the impact of 17 pieces of shrapnel in his body. But he remained in his position for five hours, tending to himself while also helping others who were wounded, until a medic and a pair of litter bearers could get to him. But that was not the end of it that day. For as he was being stretched to safety, they got caught in an enemy tank attack. As they took cover, Doss spotted a critically injured man and insisted that he be taken back on the stretcher instead of himself. While Doss waited for the litter bearers to return, he was found and helped back by a fellow soldier. Suddenly, Doss was hit by a Japanese sniper's bullet and suffered a compound fracture to his arm. The two men took cover in a shell hole, realizing how badly injured he now was. Doss instructed the soldier on how to bind his rifle stock to his shattered arm to act as a splint. Eventually pushing through, excruciating pain, he would make it back to the aid station. The US Army recognized Doss's extreme bravery and he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroic and selfless actions at Okinawa from April 29 to May 21, 1945. Because of his heroic actions, many wounded men made it back home. Desmond Doss would go on to run a small family farm with his wife, Dorothy, and lived to the age of 87.\n",
